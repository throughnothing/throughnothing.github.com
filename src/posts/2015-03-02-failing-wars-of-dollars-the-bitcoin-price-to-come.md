[Failing Wars of Dollars; The Bitcoin Price to Come - CryptoCoinsNews](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/failing-wars-dollars-bitcoin-price-come/)

> The price of Bitcoin to Come is 1 XBT to 1 XBT. Deflationary cryptocurrency is an option, and it peacefully coexists with its inflationary counterpart. With Bitcoin, no central authority can inflate the supply and force the holders to fund a war. One bitcoin will be the same amount of the total supply of bitcoins today as it will be in 100 years. If not Bitcoin, then something else â€“ perhaps whatever the AI robot overlords decide.Fiat currency is a spectacular tool for elites to steer the economy and fund war. Bitcoin allows you to withdraw from imperialism without moving across political borders.

Really well-written piece on the history of Fiat currency in the United States, and its continual use as a means to fund war and violence.
