Because of the Coronavirus lockdowns, I haven't been into Manhattan in a few months, which is crazy. I had been into Manhattan at least 2-3 times a week since moving here last year.  Yesterday, I decided to bike around Manhattan and do a little photo tour to see what things look like in the wake of these lockdowns, store closures, and now the riots / protests.  I don't have great words to describe the feeling of Manhattan yesterday, but there was hope, despair, inspiration, beauty, empty streets, but also vibrant, active blocks of activity. It was a really enjoayble ~4 hour ride across town.


Here are some of the photos I took. You can also see them all [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/throughnothing/albums/72157714706772572)
