I saw this near the Brooklyn Promenade today, and found it funny.  So many
people are walking around with a mask, but it's draped around their neck, or in
their hand. I see some folks taking the mask off, but putting it on again when
they get near other people, which I think is fine and makes sense. Having a mask with you, and still not putting it on when you're around others is a bit silly, though.
