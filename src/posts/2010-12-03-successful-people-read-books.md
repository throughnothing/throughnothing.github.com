I was re-reading an old
[blog post](http://www.ridiculouslyextraordinary.com/101-life-lessons/) by
[Karol Gadja](http://www.ridiculouslyextraordinary.com/) over at Ridiculously Extraordinary about life lessons, when one item on his list suddenly stood out and got my mind working.

## Successful People Read Books

Its true. In fact, after reading it, it seems so obvious, but its something I hadn't thought of in this way before. I follow a lot of bloggers who (I think) write very well and are successful, and almost all of them seem to devour books pretty regularly.

Of course, this all makes perfect sense. Reading expands our knowledge base, and introduces us to new, creative ideas. Reading also helps expose us to different writing styles and different cultures -- both of which can improve our own writing.

Those who read regularly are keeping their minds active and constantly bombarded with new experiences, thoughts, questions, provocations, and images. Under these circumstances it would be hard for the mind to not pop out a unique idea of its own.

If you want to be a well-rounded, successful, thought-filled individual, turn off the TV and pick up a book. What are you reading today?
