My wife and I have now been locked down and working from home for 83 days since
March 8th. One things I noticed after just a few days of was that I was feeling
sluggish, lethargic, and mentally foggy. I started to add some walks into my
daily routine whenever the weather was nice enough, and that definitely helped,
but I knew I needed to find a way to get more substantive workouts in during
quarantine. With gyms closed, and not knowing how long this situation would
last, I decided to start doing bodyweight strength training at home.

After some googling and help from
[r/bodyweightfitness](https://reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitess) I decided to get a
doorway pull-up bar, and some gymnastic rings. Of course, as you probably know,
all fitness equipment has been sold out everywhere online for a while, but I did
manage to find them in-stock after a bit of searching.

Since getting them, I've been getting in some pretty amazing workouts, and have
_really_ been enjoying the rings a lot more than I thought I would -- they make
workouts fun. The workouts can be way more intense, and fun, than I expected,
and many of the movevments are way harder than you'd imagine on the rings
because of the lack of stability they provide.  Dips and push-ups on the rings,
for example, are much harder than their usual variants.

I also picked up a copy of [Overcoming
Gravity](https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Gravity-Systematic-Gymnastics-Bodyweight/dp/0990873854/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=overcoming+gravity&qid=1590815855&sr=8-1),
which I think is _the bible_ for calisthenics and bodyweight training. I would
highly recommend this book if you're interested in this.

You can work your entire upper body with the gymnastic rings, and increase the
intensity (read: difficulty) of the excercises to almost any strength level.
Here are just some of the excercises and progressions I've been working on:

* Dips
  * Bulgarian (wide-arm) Dips
  * RTO (Rings turned out) Dips
* Pull-ups
  * Muscle Ups
  * L-Sit Pull-ups
* Front Tuck Lever (working towards front lever) holds
* Rows
  * Horizontal Rows
  * Front Tuck Rows
* L-Sit
* Hand Stands
  * Frog Stand
  * Wall Hand Stands
* Push-ups
  * RTO (rings turned out) push-ups
  * Pseudo-planche pushups
  * Archer / one-arm pushups


For a comprehensive suite of bodyweight and rings progressions for all skill
levels, check out the
[charts](http://stevenlow.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OG2ChartsPrint.pdf)
from the Overcoming Gravity book -- there's enough to keep you going for quite a
while.

After using the rings and doing only bodyweight work for ~60+ days now, I must
say I am enjoying it much more than my prior barbell work at the gym. With
barbell work, you do the same movements over and over, with the only
"progression" being the increasing the weight.  With rings, parallettes, and
bodyweight excercises, you are progressing and learning new skills along the
way. It really does feel like play, and when you get a new skill, you feel like
you've accomplished something. The skills I'm working towards (though they will
take me quite a while to achieve) right now are:

* 30 second free standing hand stand
* 30 second front lever
* 5 ring muscle ups
* Touch my palms to the floor with straight legs (this is a flexibility goal as I'm _very_ inflexible)
* 5 Bulgarian ring dips (achieved!)
* 10 Diamond pushups (achieved!)

I'll report back as I hit these goals, but I know these will keep me busy for a while. 

If you've been looking for a cheap, effective, space-efficient way to workout at
home, or in your local park, I _highly_ recommend trying out a pair of gymnastic
rings -- it's possibly the best $30 piece of fitness equipment you can buy
(coupled with a pull-up bar or something to hang the rings on at home, if
needed).
