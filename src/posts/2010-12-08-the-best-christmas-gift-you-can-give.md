__The best Christmas gift you can give is your time.__ Your friends and family more than likely have everything they really need, but what they often may not get enough of is your time. Spend time with them. Quality time. Listen to them. Laugh with them. Let them know you are there for them.

## Gifts are just more stuff

Stuff that most of us don't need. If you have money you'd like to get rid of during the Christmas season, give it to a charity, or someone genuinely in need. Explain to others what you are doing, and even link back to this post if you think it will help them see why quality time and good company are better than any gift.

## Time is the most valuable commodity in the world

Sharing some of yours with others means more than that iPad, golf club, or purse you could buy them (and its better for the planet as well). Stop reading blogs and go share your time with someone special. You won't regret it. Go. Now.
