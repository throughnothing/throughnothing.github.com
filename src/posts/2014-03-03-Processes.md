Structured processes are incredibly useful, and often necessary,
beasts.  They are, however, almost never the _most_ important things for a
project.  We shouldn't hold on to and adhere to processes just because.
Processes are in place to ensure the quality and timeliness of our work.
When they cease to work towards this end, its _ok_ to break the mold.
Live a little sometimes: let go, buck the man, don't mark that jira ticket
`closed` even though it's been deployed, it'll be ok, I promise.  Say 'no' to a
meeting when you're in the zone getting-shit-doneâ„¢, tackle a ticket that isn't
assigned to you, or even *gasp* fix a bug that hasn't even been filed yet.

What process have you ignored recently?
