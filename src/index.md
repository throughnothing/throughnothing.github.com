# William Wolf

------------------

I'm an engineer, builder, and investor living in New York City.
I spend most of my time in the cryptocurrency world on the investment team
at [Polychain Capital](https://polychain.capital).

I'm originally from New Orleans. I studied Computer Engineering, Music, and Math at Virginia Tech,
and have since worked on various software startups in the Virginia, Washington D.C.,
and San Francisco areas. I've grown, mangaged, and led engeering teams from 1 to 20+ and
been through 2 acquisitions (Webmail.us -> Rackspace, and Tilt -> Airbnb).

I like to
[read](/reading.html),
make music (mostly guitar),
travel,
[tweet](https://twitter.com/throughnothing),
excercise,
[build](https://github.com/throughnothing),
invest,
[write](writing.html),
and keep things [simple](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/897002-our-life-is-frittered-away-by-detail-simplicity-simplicity-simplicity-i).

I'm always interested to meet other likeminded folks, so don't hesitate to reach out on any of the platforms in the sidebar -- I look forward to hearing from you.

Below I've linked to some more detailed posts about various topics and areas of interest that are important to me.

* **Economics, Finance, and Politics** - Right before the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, I
  started to become interested in economics and finance. My interest in these
  topics was sparked by the presidential campaign of 
  [Ron Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul) in 2007. He said crazy
  things about the Federal Reserve, and espoused very contrarian (almost heretical)
  views of economics and fiscal policy. Skeptical, though I was, I researched some
  of what he said, and found myself devouring economics and history books for
  several years to learn everything I could on the topic -- something I'd never
  had the slightest interest in prior. My research led me to a deeper understanding
  of money, as well as the basics of Austrian Economics (*real* economics -- not the stuff wof
  the Paul Krugmans, and Ben Bernankes). Having this understanding has led me towards
  more free-market ideals, and has made me much more apathetic towards the political
  system in the United States where neither party advocates for sound fiscal, monetary,
  or economic policies -- which, in my opinion, are the most important foundations for
  a healthy society.

* **Cryptocurrency** - I believe that cryptocurrencies will give people around the
  world a means to save, transact, and interact voluntarily and without fear of
  censorship, confiscation, or devaluation from their governments. Money is 1/2 of
  every transaction in the world, and given governments' continual proclivity
  to abuse their power over money, I think taking this power back from governments
  is one of the most important things we can do for a healthy economy and more 
  prosperous society. I've been passionate about cryptocurrencies since learning
  about Bitcoin, and going down the figurative rabbit hole in 2011.
  
* **Software Development** - After many years writing production code that inevitably grew
  into a hard to maintain tangled mess as teams and lines of code grew, I discovered
  [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). I have
  since become an advocate of strongly typed, declarative, and ideally pure,
  code -- especially for complex code that will have large development teams. My favorite
  language to build stuff in these days is [Purescript](https://www.purescript.org), though
  I'm a huge fan of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), and obviously
  [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) as well.

* **Food** - I say food here because I don't like the term "diet".  I've learned that
  healthy eating actually needs to be a long-term lifestyle choice, not a temporary diet.
  My conscious journey with food started in 2007. Growing up I was always
  a pretty skinny kid, and relatively fit, though I never had to try or work for that,
  and could always eat whatever I wanted. After a post-graduation vacation, I
  looked back at some of the photos and was shocked at what saw. "Wow, I'm fat", I thought.
  The weight had crept up on me, and I didn't realize it until seeing a photo and hardly
  recognizing myself. This sent me down a multi-year (decade?) journey that still continues today. First,
  reading [Michael Pollan's](https://michaelpollan.com)
  [In Defense of Food](https://michaelpollan.com/books/in-defense-of-food/), which set me off
  on a course of vegetarianism for 3 years. I started off strong, but over time on a vegetarian diet,
  I realized I was eating a lot of pasta, pizza, breads, and I wasn't losing weight or feeling that
  much healthier. I started learning about the
  [perils of grains](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/why-grains-are-unhealthy/)
  from [Mark Sisson](https://www.marksdailyapple.com), and thinking about how grains were now
  the majority of my diet. Shortly after, [Robb Wolff's](https://robbwolf.com)
  [The Paleo Diet]() book motivated me to try to cut out grains from my diet. I knew, however
  that cutting out grains and staying vegetarian would starve me, so I decided I would add in 
  fish and eat basically salads and fish (mostly salmon) for 30 days.  Wow, I felt great! After
  3 years of vegetarianism, I told my girlfriend at the time (now wife) "let's go to a steakhouse",
  and, in 2010, my journey down the Paleo way of eating began. Since then, I've stayed mostly on the
  "Paleo" track, but have dabbled with a strict Ketogenic diet for ~2 years after reading
  [The Art And Science Of Low Carbohydrate Living](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Science-Low-Carbohydrate-Living/dp/0983490708/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=art+and+science+of+low+carbohydrate+living&qid=1590290393&sr=8-1)
  (which I highly recommend!)


* **Fitness** - Since my

* **Free Will** - I don't think we have it. I've read a lot of books, essays, and papers
  on the topic, but the main thrust of my thinking was inspired by the book 
  [Free Will](https://samharris.org/books/free-will/) by
  [Sam Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Harris)

* **Good and Bad** - "There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so" -- Shakespear.
  Good and Bad are human constructs. We often instinctively feel something is "good" or "bad", but
  I think it's helpful to take a step back, and realize that something is only good or bad based
  on your perspetive, and desired outcomes. Things are only good or bad, towards some end. Money
  printing is not "bad", it's beneficial for some, and detrimental to others. You can't speak of
  good or bad without stating your desired outcome, and for whom or for what something is good or
  bad *for*.
