  <p>Because of the Coronavirus lockdowns, I haven’t been into Manhattan in a few months, which is crazy. I had been into Manhattan at least 2-3 times a week since moving here last year. Yesterday, I decided to bike around Manhattan and do a little photo tour to see what things look like in the wake of these lockdowns, store closures, and now the riots / protests. I don’t have great words to describe the feeling of Manhattan yesterday, but there was hope, despair, inspiration, beauty, empty streets, but also vibrant, active blocks of activity. It was a really enjoayble ~4 hour ride across town.</p>
<p>Here are some of the photos I took. You can also see them all <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/throughnothing/albums/72157714706772572">here</a></p>

    <title>Playing With Observable Notebooks</title>

  </div>
  <p>I had been wanting to play around with the programming notebooks created by <a href="https://observablehq.com/">ObservableHQ</a>. They are a new type of programming notebook, very similar to <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a>, but they run Javascript, and can run entirely in the browser. Observable notebooks also us an observable pattern, where all cells which depend on a variable are automatically updated whenever the underlying variables change. This also eliminates the reliance on ordering of cells, as they can be ordered in any way that makes sense, rather than ordered by their dependences. To learn about more differences butween Observables and Jupyter you can check out <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observable-for-jupyter-users">Observable for Jupyter Users</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bitcoin-futures-basis-trade">Bitcoin Futures Basis Trade</h2>
<p>Yesterday I decided to see if I could build a quick futures basis rate calculator for Bitcoin futures. The “basis rate” is the spread that exists between a future, and the current spot price of an asset. When the asset futures are in contango, this rate will be positive, because the future price is higher than the current spot price. Conversely, the basis rate will be negative when the asset futures are in backwardation.</p>
<p>It turned out to be super quick and easy. I’ve embedded the resulting table belowe, but you can also check out the entire notebook <a href="https://observablehq.com/@throughnothing/crypto-basis-trade-calculator">here</a>. I’m calculating the annualized APY for each futures product available on <a href="https://www.deribit.com/">Deribit</a> using their public <a href="https://docs.deribit.com/">v2 api</a>. The notebook updates itself every 5 seconds (adjustable by the user on the ObservableHQ site) with the latest prices and rates. Do note that I’m currently calculating the APY (annualized basis rate) based on the <code>mark_price</code> rather than the <code>last_price</code>. I’m also using the <code>BTC-PERPETUAL</code> as a proxy for the current spot price of Bitcoin, as you can’t actually trade spot on Deribit. As with any moving, volatile market, you may not actually be able to capture that APY, but it gives a good reference for comparison of where rates are at. This is also, obviously, not investment advice. The <code>percent_delta</code> column is the simple percentage delta between the <code>BTC-PERPETUAL</code> <code>mark_price</code>, and the respective futures’ <code>marke_price</code>, to give you an idea of the actual rate, vs the annualized APY.</p>

<p>I think this will be a useful tool to prototype ideas quickly, and share them with others without having to have a server running or have each person set up a local development environment. I look forward to making use of this tool more in the future.</p>
<p>I also want to play with <a href="https://polynote.org/">Polynote</a> a bit more, as it can leverage more languages (Scala, Python, Haskell), and is probably better suited for things that require a bit more computation, as well as things that may need to talk to private APIs.</p>

    <title>Claiming Handshake (HNS) Airdrop Tokens</title>

</figure>
<p>The <a href="https://handshake.org">Handshake Network</a> launched relatively silently in February of this year. As part of the launch, the network contains a <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org/hs-tree-data">merkle tree</a> filled with nonces (random numbers) encrypted to the PGP and/or SSH keys of ~175,000 Github users, 30,000 PGP keys from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust#Strong_set">PGP WOT Strongset</a>, and thousands more Hacker News and Keybase accounts that were identified as of 2/4/2019 by the Handshake team. Additionally, there was a window of time where anyone could signe up to the Handshake Faucet and recieve tokens from their interest in the project (this is what I did).</p>
<p>These encrypted nonce values are hard-coded into the network such that any of these individuals has a right and ability to claim some amount of HNS tokens (4,246.994314 HNS for most users) on the live Handshake network. This Airdrop system was designed to more fairly distribute the network tokens to builders and developers across the internet who are likely to be interested in seeing a freer, more decentralized naming and certificate system for the web.</p>
<h2 id="claiming-airdrop-tokens">Claiming Airdrop Tokens</h2>
<p>The Handshake team has provided a <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org/hsd#auctions">tool</a> that enables these users to find their nonce in the tree, and send a message to the live Handshake network claiming their tokens. While we at Polychain are early investors in the Handshake Network, and have been active with the network since it’s launch, I hadn’t claimed my personal tokens yet. I finally went through that process today, and wanted to document it here in case it’s useful for others.</p>
<p>Do note that I wanted to claim my tokens using only software released by the Handshake team. I did not want to use third party software, or trust third party websites to do some of the work for me. Using other software or websites is risky and may result in stolen tokens.</p>
<h2 id="hsd">hsd</h2>
<p>To start off, you will need to get a <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org/hsd">handshake daemon (hsd)</a> running locally. Luckily this is pretty easy:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span class="fu">git</span> clone https://github.com/handshake-org/hsd</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span class="bu">cd</span> hsd</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a><span class="ex">npm</span> install</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a><span class="co"># Just leave this running in it&#39;s own terminal window for now</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a><span class="ex">./bin/hsd</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="creating-a-wallet">Creating a wallet</h2>
<p>If you created a wallet from the Handshake Faucet, you can skip this step, and the next step. Only users claiming from an SSH or PGP key from Github, Keybase, etc. need to do this, and use hs-airdrop.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span class="co"># Still in the hsd/ repo from above</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a><span class="ex">./bin/hsw-cli</span> account create account1</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will print something like:</p>

<p>You’ll want to save the <code>receiveAddress</code> above, as that’s where we’ll be sending your claimed coins to. Additionally, you’ll want to backup your master key someplace safe, so you’ll always have it and not lose your HNS tokens. You can do that with this:</p>

<p>From this you can backup either the <code>xprivkey</code> or the <code>phrase</code> words. You will be able to regenerate your wallet from either of these in the future.</p>
<h2 id="hs-airdrop">hs-airdrop</h2>
<p>Next, if you didn’t use the Handshake Faucet, you’ll need the <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org/hs-airdrop">hs-airdrop</a> tool.</p>
<p><strong>I learned the hard way that you no longer need to use the <code>hs-airdrop</code> tool to claim tokens if you registered an address with the Handshake Faucet. Those tokens will just be waiting for you in your wallet. You can skip to the last section on verifying your Handshake Faucet tokens below.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org/hs-airdrop/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for the <code>hs-airdrop</code> tool is pretty self explanatory, but I’ve shown the various ways you may need to use it below. In all of the commands below, the <code>hs1...</code> should be your <code>receiveAddress</code> created above.</p>

<p>To send your claim to the network, you’ll want to go back to your <code>hsd/</code> directory and do the following:</p>

<p>If all went well, congrats, you have now claimed your HNS tokens to your wallet. It will take about 100 blocks before you will be able to use them, but they are safely yours.</p>
<h2 id="verifying-your-handshake-faucet-tokens">Verifying your Handshake Faucet Tokens</h2>
<p>If you signed up through the Handshake Faucet prior to launch, you’ll want to setup a wallet and verify that you have your tokens. All you need for this is the <code>hsd</code> daemon running, and to import your wallet, like so:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span class="ex">./bin/hsw-cli</span> mkwallet [wallet-name] --mnemonic=<span class="st">&quot;seed words from your handshake faucet backup&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a><span class="ex">./bin/hsw-cli</span> rescan --id=[wallet-name]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once it rescans (shouldn’t take long), your wallet should now show your balance:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span class="ex">./bin/hsw-cli</span> balance --id=[wallet-name]</span></code></pre></div>
<h1 id="hopefully-youve-got-your-tokens-now">Hopefully you’ve got your tokens now</h1>
<p>That’s it. You now hopefully have access to your HNS tokens, and can start bidding on name <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org/hsd#auctions">auctions</a>, or hodl until you have better ideas.</p>
<p>I hope you found this helpful – let me know your thoughts <a href="https://twitter.com/throughnothing">on twitter</a> either way.</p>

  <p>My wife and I have now been locked down and working from home for 83 days since March 8th. One things I noticed after just a few days of was that I was feeling sluggish, lethargic, and mentally foggy. I started to add some walks into my daily routine whenever the weather was nice enough, and that definitely helped, but I knew I needed to find a way to get more substantive workouts in during quarantine. With gyms closed, and not knowing how long this situation would last, I decided to start doing bodyweight strength training at home.</p>

<p>After some googling and help from <a href="https://reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitess">r/bodyweightfitness</a> I decided to get a doorway pull-up bar, and some gymnastic rings. Of course, as you probably know, all fitness equipment has been sold out everywhere online for a while, but I did manage to find them in-stock after a bit of searching.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/2020/05/30/staying-healthy-during-coronavirus/IMG_1969.jpeg" alt="" /><figcaption>Pull-up Bar Gymnastic Rings Setup</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Since getting them, I’ve been getting in some pretty amazing workouts, and have <em>really</em> been enjoying the rings a lot more than I thought I would – they make workouts fun. The workouts can be way more intense, and fun, than I expected, and many of the movevments are way harder than you’d imagine on the rings because of the lack of stability they provide. Dips and push-ups on the rings, for example, are much harder than their usual variants.</p>
<p>I also picked up a copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Overcoming-Gravity-Systematic-Gymnastics-Bodyweight/dp/0990873854/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=overcoming+gravity&amp;qid=1590815855&amp;sr=8-1">Overcoming Gravity</a>, which I think is <em>the bible</em> for calisthenics and bodyweight training. I would highly recommend this book if you’re interested in this.</p>
<p>You can work your entire upper body with the gymnastic rings, and increase the intensity (read: difficulty) of the excercises to almost any strength level. Here are just some of the excercises and progressions I’ve been working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dips
<ul>
<li>Bulgarian (wide-arm) Dips</li>
<li>RTO (Rings turned out) Dips</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pull-ups
<ul>
<li>Muscle Ups</li>
<li>L-Sit Pull-ups</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Front Tuck Lever (working towards front lever) holds</li>
<li>Rows
<ul>
<li>Horizontal Rows</li>
<li>Front Tuck Rows</li>
</ul></li>
<li>L-Sit</li>
<li>Hand Stands
<ul>
<li>Frog Stand</li>
<li>Wall Hand Stands</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Push-ups
<ul>
<li>RTO (rings turned out) push-ups</li>
<li>Pseudo-planche pushups</li>
<li>Archer / one-arm pushups</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For a comprehensive suite of bodyweight and rings progressions for all skill levels, check out the <a href="http://stevenlow.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/OG2ChartsPrint.pdf">charts</a> from the Overcoming Gravity book – there’s enough to keep you going for quite a while.</p>
<p>After using the rings and doing only bodyweight work for ~60+ days now, I must say I am enjoying it much more than my prior barbell work at the gym. With barbell work, you do the same movements over and over, with the only “progression” being the increasing the weight. With rings, parallettes, and bodyweight excercises, you are progressing and learning new skills along the way. It really does feel like play, and when you get a new skill, you feel like you’ve accomplished something. The skills I’m working towards (though they will take me quite a while to achieve) right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 second free standing hand stand</li>
<li>30 second front lever</li>
<li>5 ring muscle ups</li>
<li>Touch my palms to the floor with straight legs (this is a flexibility goal as I’m <em>very</em> inflexible)</li>
<li>5 Bulgarian ring dips (achieved!)</li>
<li>10 Diamond pushups (achieved!)</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll report back as I hit these goals, but I know these will keep me busy for a while.</p>
<p>If you’ve been looking for a cheap, effective, space-efficient way to workout at home, or in your local park, I <em>highly</em> recommend trying out a pair of gymnastic rings – it’s possibly the best $30 piece of fitness equipment you can buy (coupled with a pull-up bar or something to hang the rings on at home, if needed).</p>

<p>I saw this near the Brooklyn Promenade today, and found it funny. So many people are walking around with a mask, but it’s draped around their neck, or in their hand. I see some folks taking the mask off, but putting it on again when they get near other people, which I think is fine and makes sense. Having a mask with you, and still not putting it on when you’re around others is a bit silly, though.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<div class="post">
  <h1><a href="/2020/03/17/Market-Valuations">Market Valuations</a></h1>
  <span class="post-date">17 Mar 2020</span>
  <hr/>
  <div class="tags">
    <a title="All pages tagged &#39;economics&#39;." href="/archive/economics/index.html">economics</a>, <a title="All pages tagged &#39;markets&#39;." href="/archive/markets/index.html">markets</a>
  </div>
  <p>I was doing some rough analysis of market valuations today compared to historical norms using a few long-term metrics that I like to monitor. These metrics are not timing signals, nor do they tell you where the market will go next. They are useful to understand where we are in the cycle and where we currently sit on the valuation spectrum.</p>
<p>This analysis is done only looking at the S&amp;P500 Index, as a proxy for “markets”. Today the S&amp;P500 closed at: 2529.19</p>
<h2 id="cape-shiller-pe">CAPE (Shiller P/E)</h2>
<p>CAPE is a crude metric that just tracks the price vs the 10 year trailing earnings. This smooths out business cycles, and has proven to be a pretty good, but fuzzy, indicator of where business valuations stand relative to their long term, durable, earnings power. As you can see below, we’ve seen a significant improvement in this metric over recent weeks, but still remain in overvalued territory.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/2020/03/17/Market-Valuations/shillerpe.png" alt="" /><figcaption>source: https://www.gurufocus.com/shiller-PE.php</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The historical mean for CAPE going back more than 100 years has been 17. Today we stand at 24.2, which is 42.6% higher than the mean. A reversion to the historical mean would require a further 29.8% (42.6/142.6) decline from today’s (3/17) close. This would take the S&amp;P 500 to $1775.49.</p>
<p>At the 2007 market peak, the CAPE was 27.4 – not much higher than where we still stand today. At the market’s bottom in 2009, the CAPE touched 13.30 (but not for long!), which was below the long term mean of 17, and considered undervalued. If todays S&amp;P500 were to reach to a 13.3 CAPE, with present 10-year earnings, the S&amp;P500 would need to fall to $1390.00, or another 45% from todays prices.</p>
<h2 id="market-cap-gdp">Market Cap / GDP</h2>
<p>Another indicator, made famous by Warren Buffett, is the proportion of the total Market Cap of all stocks relative to the US GDP. This is also a very crude metric, which can be impacted over time by things like private companies staying private longer (and being bigger), and public companies doing more and more business internationally, but I think it is still a useful heuristic to look at and consider. There are also counter-effects, such as government spending becoming a larger and larger portion of GDP, which would have the effect of moving this average down (businesses make up a smaller portion of GDP). Below you can see the historical total market cap in blue, and US GDP in green.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/2020/03/17/Market-Valuations/tmtgdp.png" alt="" /><figcaption>source: https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another way to look at this is by plotting the ratio between the two. The historical average ratio is around 0.8 – that is, where the total market cap of public stocks is around 80% of US GDP.</p>
<figure>
<img src="/2020/03/17/Market-Valuations/tmtgdpratio.png" alt="" /><figcaption>source: https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At present, the total market cap is 115.9% of GDP, which is 30.9% ((115.9-80)/115.9) above the historical average of 80%. If we use the S&amp;P500 as a proxy for total markets, it would need to fall to $1745.77 to be valued at the historical average levels using this metric. The present valuations, using this metric, are still higher than they were at the peak of the market in late 2007 (the total market cap was 110.10% of GDP then)!</p>
<p>At the market’s bottom in 2009, the market was valued at 57% of US GDP (and GDP had contracted, as I’m sure you’re aware). To get to an undervaluation of 57% of current GDP, with no contraction in GDP, the S&amp;P500 would need to fall another 50.82% to $1243.86.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>It’s interesting that both of these valuation metrics, give very similar numbers for “fair value” on the markets of around $1745-$1775 on the S&amp;P500, based on current GDP, and current trailing earnings. They also give similar “undervaluation” prices, if we were to assume we achieve valuations similar to those reached in 2009, which would put the S&amp;P500 in the $1250-$1400 range. Note that the 2009 undervaluation was relatively brief, and less severe than virtually all recessions before it, with the 2000-2003 recession being the exception.</p>
<p>In 2008/2009 the market only went below the mean for &lt; 12 months (around Dec 2008 - July 2009 on both metrics). The 2000 recession actually never reverted fully to the mean in CAPE valuations (seeing a low of around 21), but did go a bit below the mean in terms of Market Cap / GDP. With the benefit of hindsight, we know now that it would have been quite prudent to have invested during either of these windows.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to stress that the numbers above are not predictions! They are just simple mathematical extrapolations of historical data, assuming certain mean reversions were to happen. The market can stay overvalued (or undervalued) for quite some time, and there’s no rule that these levels have to be hit, and certainly no indication on timing if they do. There are also many other valuation metrics out there, but, I tend to favor a long-term mindset, and think that markets will continue to be weighing machines in the long term and voting machines in the short term.</p>
<p>With everything going on with Coronavirus in the markets, I find it useful to keep an eye on the long term, and to understand that “this, too, shall pass”. There will be short term pain, but the long term value of good businesses will be little changed (see here, for a good case as to why that is <a href="https://brooklyninvestor.blogspot.com/2020/03/who-cares-what-mr-market-thinks.html">here</a>).</p>

  <p>I’m getting into Java services at work, and I put together a guide with some principles / best practices to follow for Java 8.  A lot of these things become much more possible with Java 8 than they would have been in earlier versions of Java, but they can also be applied to other programming languages and technologies.</p>
<p>I wrote this guide based on a desire to have code that is easy to reason about and understand, which means it will be easy for new folks to jump into the codebase over time, and also with a desire to quickly produce high quality code.  Performance is not the major concern of this guide.</p>
<p>Many of the principles and ideas come from my foray into functional programming with both <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> and <a href="http://www.purescript.org">Purescript</a>, and I just find that these concepts are the way I prefer to program now.  Following these principles gives me much more confidence in the correctness of my code, and gives me peace of mind knowing that I’m giving myself the best chance of understanding the code when I come back to it months or years later.</p>
<p>Without further ado, you can check out the guide <a href="https://gist.github.com/throughnothing/4a14dd3e4ab5e68eb154123ad11dae79">here</a> (inlined below).</p>

<h1 id="java-8-coding-guide">Java 8 Coding Guide</h1>
<p>This coding guide was written for a Java 8 project, but contains principles that are valid in many languages. It is aimed at producing code that is easy to reason about, easy to validate and test, easy to maintain, and easy to avoid common bugs and pitfalls.</p>
<h2 id="avoid-explicit-null-or-dont-use-null">Avoid explicit <code>null</code> (or, Don’t use <code>null</code>)</h2>
<p><code>Null</code> is famously the <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2015/08/31/the-worst-mistake-of-computer-science/">“billion dollar mistake”</a> (and that’s probably an under-estimation!). Don’t use <code>null</code> as a way of representing error or failure, and also don’t use <code>null</code> as a way to avoid passing a certain argument to a function. Essentially you should never explicitly use a <code>null</code> value unless you are checking that something is not <code>null</code>. Even in those cases, it should probably be handled better by an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="expressions-over-statements">Expressions over statements</h2>
<p>Expressions are declarative and evaluate to (and return) a value, while statements are imperative bits of code that perform actions. Because of this, expressions are easier to reason about, debug, and verify correctness for.</p>
<p>A simple example is an <code>if</code> statement, vs an <code>if</code> expression. <code>If</code> in java does not return a value, nor does java enforce that an <code>if</code> have an <code>else</code> branch. Additionally, if there is an <code>else</code> branch, it does not have to result in the same type of value as the <code>if</code> branch. This makes if statements hard to reason about and understand. The ternary form <code>predicate ? value : value</code> is preferable to <code>if</code>/<code>then</code> statements.</p>
<p>In a language like Java, statements will be required, but we should isolate those to their own, small, methods, and keep their surface area as small as possible to reduce risk and complexity from these parts of the code.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="avoid-explicit-loops">Avoid explicit loops</h2>
<p>With Java 8, we have streams, and should no longer need explicit loops. Loops are very repetetive, and error prone, so we should leverage abstractions that handle looping for us to avoid bugs, verbosity, and complexity in our code.</p>
<p>There may be some cases where loops are more desirable (possibly for performance), but they should be avoided until it is clear they are actually needed.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="use-immutable-data-structures">Use immutable data structures</h2>
<p>We should leverage <code>guava</code>’s immutable data structures as much as possible to avoid complicated bugs related to mutating state.</p>
<p>Additionally, we should leverage Lombok’s <code>@Value</code> objects as much as possible to make our own data objects immutable.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="dont-throw-exceptions---use-values">Don’t throw exceptions - use values!</h2>
<p>In general, we should never throw an exception of our own. Obviously we will use libraries that throw exceptions. These exceptions should be caught directly in the function/method using the library, and turned into values (to be returned) as much as possible.</p>
<p>This is because exceptions are like <code>goto</code> statements, which make the flow of your program much more difficult to reason about. Every function that throws an exception can return a value in 2 ways, through the “normal” return flow, or through an exception, and every user of that function has to think about both cases. It is generally easier to reason about functions that only return values (something like vavr’s <a href="http://www.baeldung.com/vavr-either">Either</a> or <a href="http://www.baeldung.com/vavr-try">Try</a> types work very well for this). This also makes it much easier to leverage Java 8’s lambda-using utilities, as they don’t like accepting <code>Function</code>s that throw exceptions.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="fail-early-enforce-invariants">Fail early, enforce invariants</h2>
<p>It is always best to fail as early as possible, at the soonest point that you find something is wrong. This often means that we should validate all of our data up front, to decouple validation from the business logic that needs to use the values in question.</p>
<p>Additionally, the more we can make fail at compile time, rather than run time, the better off we will be at finding bugs earlie. Use Java’s typesystem as much as you can to enforce invariants statically!</p>
<p>For our own data objects, we should have strong validation of each object, so that once we’ve constructed one, we know it will have good data in the rest of our program. Failed construction (on validation errors) should also be expressed by returning values, rather than exceptions. Something like vavr’s <a href="">Validation</a> type is useful for this purpose. Make it impossible to construct a “bad”/invalid data object!</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="composition-over-inheritance">Composition over Inheritance</h2>
<p>Inheritance can be very fragile, and make refactoring of complex code involving inheritance hierarchies very difficult to do safely and confidently. Composition (and in java, Interfaces) should be favored over inheritence where possible.</p>
<p>Often inheritance is required by certain frameworks / libraries, but we should limit the depth of inheritance hierarchies that we use as much as possible.</p>
<p>Composition, via composing interfaces or composable types, allows for more design flexibility, and easier, more confident refactoring.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/07/05/fbi-director-james-comey-we-will-not-indict-hillary-clinton-even-though-there-is-evidence-of-violations/">recent news</a> around Hilary Clinton and her lack of prosecution for clearly violating many laws (even in the opinion of would-be prosecutors) just perpetuates the growing global sentiment of “Us” vs “Them”. This is a growing divide, and more people are becoming disgruntled, disenfranchised, and disconnected from the system every day.</p>
<p>There’s a political class that is clearly treated differently, and beholden to a different set of rules, and people the world over are getting fed up with it. The people of the United Kingdom were fed up with the far off “them” in the EU, and the people in France, Italy, Spain, and Greece are pretty fed up too.</p>
<p>Where will this lead? Ultimately it’ll land us in a better place. People will demand more fairness, and a closing of the gap between “Us” and “Them”, but it may get pretty nasty in the interim.</p>

  <p>Don’t tell people things.  That is arrogant.  Ask questions and let them discover their passions, their conflicts, their misunderstandings, and who they are through their own answers and internal discoveries.</p>
<p>In doing so, you may even end up learning more about yourself.</p>

  <p>I was re-reading an old <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/04/mish-interview-with-bitcoin-jesus.html">Mish article</a> on Bitcoin, and read this phrase from Mish:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet, should that happen or even be suspected, how long will it take before there is a government crackdown on bitcoin? Should such a thing happen, the value of bitcoin can plunge to next to nothing if confidence is lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But hasn’t gold been cracked down by many governments in the past, including the US?  What happened to its value on the black market in these cases?  Certainly, over the long term, we can see that it hasn’t had much impact on the price of gold, other than maybe in the upwards direction.</p>
